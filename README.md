# Tic-Tac-Toe-Game
## Training Your MENANCE Player

Here is a sample run of the system.

```
java GameMain
(1) Menace against a human player
(2) Train Menace against perfect player
(3) Train Menace against random player
(4) Train Menace against another menace
(5) Delete (both) Menace training sets
(6) Human to play perfect player
(7) Perfect player to play human
(8) Human against a menace player
(Q)uit
```

And we will play Menace against a human ("1"):

```

```

And here is the result.

As can be seen, so far MENACE is not really good and lost twice in a
row despite being first player. Let’s now train it against a perfect player.


```
(1) Menace against a human player
(2) Train Menace against perfect player
(3) Train Menace against random player
(4) Train Menace against another menace
(5) Delete (both) Menace training sets
(6) Human to play perfect player
(7) Perfect player to play human
(8) Human against a menace player
(Q)uit
2
```

The output is

```
About to train with 500 games.
Player 1 has won 0 games, lost 182 games, and 318 were draws.
Over the last 50 games, this player has won 0, lost 4, and tied 46.

Player 2 has won 182 games, lost 0 games, and 318 were draws.
Over the last 50 games, this player has won 4, lost 0, and tied 46.
```

MENACE (which is Player 1) has lost 182 games against the perfect player
in the 500 that were played, and only 4 of the last 50 games.

Let us try again as a human player against a trained MENACE.

```
   |   |

 X |   |

O to play: 5

O to play: 3

Result: DRAW
 O | X | O

 X | O | X

 X | O | X
```

Now, MENACE is a much better player, and plays indeed very well and got a draw. Note however that it is not perfect and can still be beaten.

Look at this partial game:

```
   |   | X
-----------
   |   |
-----------
   |   |

O to play: 1
 O |   | X
-----------
   | X |
-----------
   |   |
```

Here we (Player 2) will make a terrible move (on purpose, I swear) and see how the MENACE player reacts.

```
O to play: 4
 O | X | X
-----------
 O | X |
-----------
   |   |
```

We see that MENACE did not make the best move to win the game.  The MENACE player has
not been trained at all to handle these "100% can win" scenarios like our perfect player
would have played.  This illustrates some of the challenges in machine learning,
but that is an entire different discussion!
